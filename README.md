## Project Overview
This objective of this project is to predict solar energy generation using advanced analytical methods. The specific objectives include:
-  Analyzing historical data on solar energy production and relevant weather conditions.
-  Developing forecasting models using time series analysis technique, SARIMA.
-  Incorporating machine learning algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosting.
-  Evaluating the models' performance using metrics like root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
